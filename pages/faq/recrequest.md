# Requesting a Recommendation

If you've reached this page, you're likely interested in asking me for a letter
of recommendation (or you already have!). I am happy to provide letters, and
consequently submit several hundred each year. It's almost a second job!  This
page contains instructions on how to request a letter of recommendation and what
information to provide so that I can write you the best letter possible

Before requesting a letter from me, however, you should be sure that my letter
makes sense for your application. The next section will describe what to
expect from my letter and help you decide whether it will help (or hurt!) your
chances.

## What is a "good" letter, and can I write you one?

A "good" letter of recommendation is one that says something positive about you
that *is not demonstrated by your other application materials*.  For example, a
"good" letter may testify to your strong work ethic, your passion for building a
community, or your unique insight in solving a hard problem.

I would love to write all of my students a "good" letter. Unfortunately, the
reality is that if you haven't worked with me outside of class -- either on a
project or as a tutor or TA -- I may not be able to say much about you that
isn't already said by your transcripts. Consequently, I would hesitate to say
that I can write you a "good" letter -- instead, I can write what might be
called a "standard" letter.

A "standard" letter is a testament to your performance in my class(es). It
generally includes a description of the courses you took, your grades within
them, and where this places you in the overall grade distribution. Additionally,
I try to include some information about your goals and aspirations and anything
I feel sets you apart, such as a tendency to ask insightful questions or to come
to office hours regularly. This provides a small amount of additional
information over your course transcripts, but unfortunately not much!

Below is an example of what an actual "standard" letter looks like. If I know
you only through class, your letter will look quite similar.

> Dear admissions committee,
>
> I am writing to offer my support for STUDENT's application to your graduate
> program.
>
> I am an assistant teaching professor in the Halicioglu Data Science Institute
> at the University of California, San Diego. I teach undergraduate courses in
> the theoretical foundations of data science; topics include the analysis of
> algorithms and the mathematics of machine learning. 
>
> I came to know STUDENT when they took my class on the foundations of
> algorithms for data science in YEAR. In this class students learn the basics
> of algorithm analysis and design, as well as graph theory and graph
> algorithms. STUDENT performed very well in the class, finishing in the top
> 20%. I again saw STUDENT later in my upper-division statistical machine
> learning class during QUARTER.  Again, they performed well and received an A.
> They also came to office hours regularly and asked insightful questions.
>
> From my conversations with STUDENT I understand that they are interested in
> bioinformatics and biostatistics. I feel that the rigorous data science
> training STUDENT received at UCSD makes them well-prepared for your graduate
> program.

Before asking me to write a letter for you, you should first consider whether I
will be able to write you a "good" letter or a "standard" one. A helpful rule of
thumb here is to ask what I can say about you that isn't already in your
transcripts. If you conclude that I would likely write a "standard" letter, you
should follow up by asking yourself if there might be someone else who can write
you a "good" letter. Again, I'm happy to write a letter for you -- but not at
the cost of weakening your application!

## Does a "standard" letter hurt your chances?

My hope as an instructor is to provide you with the best training and advice for
your future. Therefore I feel it would be academic malpractice not to warn you
that a "standard" letter might actually *hurt* your chances at being admitted to
very competitive programs. A top school might expect you to be able to find
three people who can write you "good" letters, and including a "standard" letter
in your application is a signal that you were unable to do so.

That said, I feel that admissions committees must be realistic. At a large
school like UCSD, it can be hard to find three people who know you well enough
to write three good letters. But I also believe that many students, not
understanding the role of recommendations, mistakenly choose their letter
writers based on the classes in which they received the highest grade as opposed
to who knows them best.

## Instructions for requesting a letter

If you've read the above and would like to request that I write a letter for
you, here's how to do so in a way that will help me efficiently write the best
letter possible. Please keep in mind that I submit letters to around 500
applications each year -- if we estimate that it takes me ~3 minutes to submit a
letter, that's already over 24 hours of work, all concentrated in the span of a
few months. Following these instructions will help me stay sane!

1. Send me an email with your letter request and the following information:
    - the courses you took with me (quarter and year) and your grades in them
    - the type of program(s) you're applying for (e.g., M.S. in statistics)
    - what you hope to do after graduating (e.g., work as a data engineer in industry)
    - any miscellaneous things I can add to your letter that say something about
      you that isn't in your transcripts. (e.g., came to office hours regularly,
      got the highest accuracy on the machine learning project)
    - your pronouns (they, he, she, etc.)

2. I'll respond and let you know whether I can write you a "standard" letter or
   a "good" letter. In most cases, I'll be able to write a "standard" letter.

3. Typically, an application allows you to send an "invitation" to submit your
   letter to my email address. It is ideal if you send the letter invitations
   for all of your applications at one time (all on the same day). If this is
   not possible, please send the letter invitations in *as few batches as
   possible*.

4. I will process your letter requests in batches, generally within two weeks of
   them arriving in my inbox. I use my email inbox as my "todo" list for letter
   writing -- once I've cleared my inbox of all of the requests I have for you,
   I will send you an email letting you know that I have no more letters left to
   submit. If this is incorrect and there are letters remaining, please let me
   know.

5. I don't keep track of your letter's due date. Instead, I complete it within
   two weeks of the request being sent. As a consequence, make sure you send me
   the invitations to submit your letters at least two weeks before they are
   due. Likewise, if it comes to within a week of your letter's deadline and I
   have not submitted it yet, please give me a gentle reminder!
