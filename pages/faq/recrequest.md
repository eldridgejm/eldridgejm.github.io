# Requesting a Recommendation

If you've reached this page, you're likely interested in asking me for a letter
of recommendation (or you already have!). I am happy to provide letters, and
consequently submit several hundred each year. It's almost a second job!

Before requesting a letter from me, however, you should be sure that my letter
makes sense for your application. The next section will describe what to
expect from my letter and help you decide whether it will help (or hurt!) your
chances.

## What is a "good" letter, and can I write you one?

A "good" letter of recommendation is one that says something positive about you
that *is not demonstrated by your other application materials*.  For example, a
"good" letter may testify to your strong work ethic, your passion for building a
community, or your unique insight in solving a hard problem.

I would love to write all of my students a "good" letter. Unfortunately, the
reality is that if you haven't worked with me outside of class -- either on a
project or as a tutor or TA -- I may not be able to say much about you that
isn't already said by your transcripts. Consequently, I would hesitate to say
that I can write you a "good" letter -- instead, I can write what might be
called a "standard" letter.

A "standard" letter is a testament to your performance in my class(es). It
generally includes a description of the courses you took, your grades within
them, and where this places you in the overall grade distribution. Additionally,
I try to include some information about your goals and aspirations and anything
I feel sets you apart, such as a tendency to ask insightful questions or to come
to office hours regularly. This provides a small amount of additional
information over your course transcripts, but unfortunately not much!

Below is an example of what an actual "standard" letter looks like. If I know
you only through class, your letter will look quite similar.

> Dear admissions committee,
>
> I am writing to offer my support for STUDENT's application to your graduate
> program.
>
> I am an assistant teaching professor in the Halicioglu Data Science Institute
> at the University of California, San Diego. I teach undergraduate courses in
> the theoretical foundations of data science; topics include the analysis of
> algorithms and the mathematics of machine learning. 
>
> I came to know STUDENT when they took my class on the foundations of
> algorithms for data science in YEAR. In this class students learn the basics
> of algorithm analysis and design, as well as graph theory and graph
> algorithms. STUDENT performed very well in the class, finishing in the top
> 20%. I again saw STUDENT later in my upper-division statistical machine
> learning class during QUARTER.  Again, they performed well and received an A.
> They also came to office hours regularly and asked insightful questions.
>
> From my conversations with STUDENT I understand that they are interested in
> bioinformatics and biostatistics. I feel that the rigorous data science
> training STUDENT received at UCSD makes them well-prepared for your graduate
> program.

Before asking me to write a letter for you, you should first consider whether I
will be able to write you a "good" letter or a "standard" one. A helpful rule of
thumb here is to ask what I can say about you that isn't already in your
transcripts. If you conclude that I would likely write a "standard" letter, you
should follow up by asking yourself if there might be someone else who can write
you a "good" letter. If you're still wondering whether my letter will be a
"good" letter or a "standard" one, feel free to ask; I'll give my honest
assessment.

## Does a "standard" letter hurt your chances?

My hope as an instructor is to provide you with the best training and advice for
your future. Therefore I feel it would be academic malpractice not to warn you
that a "standard" letter might actually *hurt* your chances at being admitted to
very competitive programs. A top school might expect you to be able to find
three people who can write you "good" letters, and including a "standard" letter
in your application is a signal that you were unable to do so.

That said, I feel that admissions committees must be realistic. At a large
school like UCSD, it can be hard to find three people who know you well enough
to write three good letters. But I also believe that many students, not
understanding the role of recommendations, mistakenly choose their letter
writers based on the classes in which they received the highest grade as opposed
to who knows them best.

If you've already asked me to write a recommendation, but after reading this
you're reconsidering, please tell me -- I don't take it personally!
